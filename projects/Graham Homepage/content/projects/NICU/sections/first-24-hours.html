            <h2>First Interactions With Your Baby</h2>
            <p>Connecting with your baby in the NICU might look different than you imagined, but these early interactions are important for both of you.</p>

                <h3>Touch</h3>
                <p>Even the gentlest touch communicates your presence to your baby. Ask your nurse about appropriate ways to touch your baby based on their condition.</p>
                <div class="method-tip">
                  <p>Try "hand hugging" by cupping your hands gently around your baby's head and feet, providing containment.</p>

                <h3>Voice</h3>
                <p>Your baby knows your voice from hearing it in the womb. Speaking or singing softly can be soothing.</p>
                <div class="method-tip">
                  <p>If you're uncomfortable talking in the NICU environment, try reading a simple children's book aloud.</p>

                <p>If your baby is stable enough, skin-to-skin contact (also called kangaroo care) provides tremendous benefits.</p>
                <div class="method-tip">
                  <p>Ask when skin-to-skin might be possible, even if it's not immediately. Having something to look forward to can help.</p>
