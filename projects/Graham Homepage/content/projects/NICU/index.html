                <p><strong>Born:</strong> 24 weeks, 1 pound 4 ounces</p>
                <p><strong>NICU Stay:</strong> 119 days</p>
                <p><strong>Major Challenges:</strong> Chronic lung disease, Grade II IVH, ROP requiring laser surgery</p>
                
                <p>
                  "When I met Sara and David, their daughter Olivia was just 3 days old and fighting for her life on a ventilator. 
                  Sara had developed severe preeclampsia, necessitating an emergency delivery. The first time they saw their tiny baby, 
                  Sara recalls being 'terrified of the tubes and wires, and afraid to even touch her.'
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  The turning point came during their first kangaroo care session at 2 weeks of age. 'When we finally held her skin-to-skin, 
                  it was like something clicked,' David shared. 'She was real, she was ours, and we could help her.'
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Olivia's journey included several setbacks—a patent ductus arteriosus requiring medication, a blood transfusion, 
                  and a brief return to CPAP after extubation. But there were also milestones worth celebrating: first bottle feed at 
                  34 weeks, moving to an open crib at 36 weeks, and finally passing her car seat test days before discharge.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  What surprised them most? 'How much our voices mattered,' Sara said. 'When we couldn't be there, we recorded stories and 
                  songs. The nurses would play them during care times, and they said her oxygen levels would stabilize when she heard us.'
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Today, Olivia is 5 years old. She still sees a pulmonologist for asthma and received early intervention services until age 3. 
                  'She's small for her age but mighty in spirit,' says Sara. 'When I look at her riding her bike or arguing with her brother, 
                  it's hard to believe she's the same fragile baby we met in the NICU.'"

                <p><strong>NICU Stay:</strong> 21 days</p>
                <p><strong>Major Challenges:</strong> Meconium aspiration syndrome, persistent pulmonary hypertension</p>
                
                <p>
                  "Miguel and Ana had a normal pregnancy and expected to take their baby home a few days after delivery. 
                  During labor, however, the doctors noted meconium in the amniotic fluid. When Ethan was born, he had difficulty 
                  breathing and was quickly transferred to the NICU.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  'We had the nursery ready, the car seat installed... we never imagined we'd go home without our baby,' Ana told me. 
                  The hardest part for them was the shock of the unexpected. They hadn't toured the NICU or prepared for complications.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Ethan needed respiratory support with a ventilator for the first week, followed by high-flow nasal cannula for 
                  another week. Miguel recalls feeling helpless: 'I'm an engineer—I fix problems. But I couldn't fix this. 
                  I had to trust the medical team completely, which was very difficult.'
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  They found comfort in the small ways they could contribute to Ethan's care: changing diapers, taking temperatures, 
                  and eventually feeding him. 'The first time I gave him a bath, I was terrified,' Ana remembers. 'But our nurse Ashley 
                  walked me through every step, and after that, I looked forward to bath time.'
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Being term parents in the NICU came with unique challenges. 'We felt almost guilty sometimes,' Miguel explained. 
                  'Our baby was one of the biggest and strongest in the unit. We'd see families of 24-weekers and feel like we shouldn't 
                  be as worried as we were. But the nurses helped us understand that every NICU journey is valid.'
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Ethan was discharged after three weeks with no ongoing medical needs. He's now a healthy 2-year-old with no lasting 
                  effects from his NICU stay. But the experience changed his parents permanently. 'We don't take anything for granted,' 
                  Ana says. 'Every milestone, every normal day—it all feels like a gift.'"

                  "Parenting twins in the NICU presents unique challenges. When I met Jen and Mark, they were overwhelmed not just by having 
                  premature babies, but by navigating different medical issues and potentially different discharge dates.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Their journey began with contractions at 28 weeks and bed rest that only delayed delivery by 5 days. Noah and Emma were 
                  born via emergency C-section when Jen developed HELLP syndrome, a serious pregnancy complication.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  'The hardest part was splitting our attention,' Jen explained. 'Noah was doing relatively well in one area of the NICU 
                  while Emma was critically ill in the intensive area. I felt constantly torn about where to be.'
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  The couple developed a system where one parent would spend time with each baby, then switch. They created a shared digital 
                  journal where they'd record updates, so each parent knew what was happening with both babies even when they couldn't be present.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  A particularly difficult moment came when Noah was ready for discharge, but Emma still needed several more weeks of care after 
                  recovering from NEC (necrotizing enterocolitis) and developing feeding difficulties. 'We felt guilty taking Noah home without 
                  Emma, but the staff helped us understand it was best for his development to leave the hospital environment.'
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  The family adapted by creating a schedule where one parent stayed home with Noah while the other visited Emma. 'It wasn't 
                  what we imagined,' Mark said, 'but we made it work one day at a time.'
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Today, the twins are 4 years old. Noah has no lasting complications from his premature birth. Emma had some feeding therapy 
                  and developmental support through early intervention but is thriving. 'They're completely different people with different 
                  strengths,' Jen says, 'but they share an incredible bond. Sometimes we catch them holding hands in their sleep, just like they 
                  did in the NICU.'"

                  <h4>Jen and Mark's advice for NICU parents of multiples:</h4>
                  <p>
                    "Create systems to manage the complex information and schedules. Don't compare your babies to each other—
                    each will progress at their own pace. And accept help from family and friends, especially after the first 
                    baby comes home. Those transitional weeks were when we needed support the most."
