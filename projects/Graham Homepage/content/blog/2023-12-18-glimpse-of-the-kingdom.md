# Glimpse of the Kingdom

A personal reflection on serving breakfast to homeless people with my children, and the profound connections that emerged from stepping outside our comfort zone.

---

This past weekend, I had the privilege of volunteering at a local homeless shelter with my five children. What started as a simple act of service became something much more profound - a glimpse into the Kingdom of God that Jesus spoke about.

## The Invitation

The invitation came through our church to help serve breakfast on a Saturday morning. I'll be honest - I was nervous. How would my kids react? Would they be scared? Would I know what to say to the people we'd be serving?

## The Experience

Walking into the shelter, I was immediately struck by the warmth and dignity of the people we met. These weren't faceless statistics or problems to be solved - they were human beings with stories, with humor, with hope.

My youngest, who is usually shy around strangers, struck up a conversation with a gentleman about his favorite cartoon characters. My oldest helped serve pancakes and found himself in deep conversation with a woman about her dreams of starting a small business.

## The Transformation

What amazed me most was the transformation I saw - not just in my children, but in myself. The barriers I had built up, the assumptions I had made, began to crumble. These were our neighbors, our community, our family.

One man, whose name was David, told me about his journey from addiction to recovery. Another woman, Maria, shared her artwork with us - beautiful sketches she created to pass the time. A young father showed us photos of his daughter, whom he hopes to reunite with soon.

## The Kingdom

Jesus talked about the Kingdom of God being like a great feast where all are welcome. That morning, serving breakfast in a humble shelter, I caught a glimpse of what He meant. The artificial barriers between "us" and "them" disappeared. We were all just people, sharing a meal, sharing stories, sharing humanity.

## The Lesson

My children learned something that day that no textbook could teach them. They learned that everyone has value, that everyone has a story, and that sometimes the greatest gift we can give is simply showing up and being present.

As we drove home, my daughter said, "Dad, when can we go back?" 

That's when I knew - we hadn't just served breakfast. We had been served something far more valuable: a reminder of what it means to be human, to be connected, to be part of something bigger than ourselves.

## The Challenge

I challenge you to step outside your comfort zone. Find a way to serve in your community. Not because you have to, but because you get to. Because in serving others, we often find that we're the ones who are truly blessed.

The Kingdom of God isn't just some distant promise - it's happening right now, in moments of connection, in acts of service, in the simple recognition that we're all in this together.
