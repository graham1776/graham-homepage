# A Cool CSS Trick I Learned for Dynamic Layouts

Recently, I was working on a component that needed a flexible layout, adapting to different content sizes. I stumbled upon a neat combination of CSS Grid and `minmax()`.

## The Problem
Creating a responsive card layout where items can vary in width but still align nicely.

## The Solution
Using `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));`

This tells the browser to fit as many columns as possible, each at least 250px wide, and to let them grow to fill the available space. It's incredibly powerful!
