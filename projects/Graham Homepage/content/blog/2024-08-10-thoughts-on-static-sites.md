# Why I Chose a Static Site Generator for My Portfolio

In the world of web development, choices abound. When it came to rebuilding my personal site, I opted for a static approach. Here's why.

## Speed
Static sites are inherently fast. Serving pre-built HTML files is significantly quicker than dynamic rendering.

## Security
With no database or complex server-side processing for content delivery, the attack surface is much smaller.

## Simplicity
Deployment is often as simple as copying files to a server or using services like GitHub Pages. Maintenance is also generally easier.

This decision aligns with my preference for performance and straightforward solutions.
