# Informational Interviews: What to Do When They Don't Want to Meet

Strategies for networking and conducting informational interviews when people prefer email over in-person meetings, and how to make the most of remote networking opportunities.

---

Here's a reality check: approximately 90% of people do NOT want to meet in person for coffee when you reach out for informational interviews. This can be discouraging, but it's not the end of the world. In fact, understanding this reality can help you develop better strategies for networking and career development.

## The Reality of Modern Networking

Most professionals today prefer answering questions via email rather than meeting in person. While email is "more efficient but less effective," it's the reality we need to work with. The key is adapting your approach to maximize the opportunities you do get while respecting people's preferences.

## Why People Prefer Email

### Time Constraints
- **Busy Schedules**: Most professionals have packed calendars
- **Efficiency**: Email allows them to respond when convenient
- **Multiple Requests**: Many people receive frequent networking requests

### Comfort Level
- **Unknown Quantity**: They don't know you personally
- **Structured Interaction**: Email feels more controlled
- **Easy Exit**: Easier to disengage if needed

## Strategies for Successful Networking

### 1. Start with Warm Contacts

Begin your networking journey with people who already know you or have some connection to you:

- **Teachers and Professors**: They're often willing to help students
- **Current Colleagues**: People you work with now
- **Friends and Family**: Don't overlook personal connections
- **Alumni Networks**: Shared school connections create instant rapport

### 2. Target the Right People

Not everyone is equally likely to respond to networking requests:

#### People More Likely to Meet
- **Professionals 5-10 years ahead of you**: They remember being in your position
- **People-focused roles**: Those in HR, sales, or consulting
- **Recent career changers**: They understand the networking process
- **Alumni from your school**: Shared experience creates connection

#### How to Identify Receptive People
Look for these clues on LinkedIn profiles:
- **Smiling profile pictures**: Often indicates a people-person
- **Product-focused job descriptions**: May be more open to helping
- **Active on social media**: Shows they enjoy connecting with others
- **Mention of mentoring or teaching**: Indicates willingness to help others

### 3. Improve Your Email Approach

Since most interactions will be via email, make them count:

#### Subject Line
- **Be Specific**: "Question about transitioning to product management"
- **Mention Connection**: "Introduction from [Mutual Contact]"
- **Keep It Short**: Avoid long, generic subject lines

#### Email Content
- **Brief Introduction**: Who you are in one sentence
- **Specific Questions**: 3-5 thoughtful, specific questions
- **Respect Their Time**: Acknowledge you understand they're busy
- **Easy to Answer**: Make questions straightforward

### 4. Maximize Email Conversations

Even if you can't meet in person, you can still build valuable relationships via email:

#### Follow-Up Strategy
- **Thank You Note**: Always send a thank you within 24 hours
- **Update Them**: Share how their advice helped you
- **Periodic Check-ins**: Brief updates on your progress
- **Offer Value**: Share relevant articles or opportunities

#### Build Long-Term Relationships
- **Stay in Touch**: Occasional updates without asking for anything
- **Provide Value**: Share opportunities that might interest them
- **Celebrate Their Success**: Congratulate them on achievements
- **Make Introductions**: Connect them with others when appropriate

## What to Do When They Say No

### Don't Take It Personally
- **It's Not About You**: They're just busy or prefer email
- **Keep the Door Open**: Thank them and leave the relationship positive
- **Try Again Later**: Circumstances change over time

### Alternative Approaches
- **Company Events**: Attend industry events where they'll be speaking
- **Online Engagement**: Engage with their content on LinkedIn
- **Mutual Connections**: Ask if they know someone else who might help
- **Group Settings**: Join professional associations where you might meet

## Making the Most of Rare In-Person Meetings

When someone does agree to meet in person, make it count:

### Preparation
- **Research Thoroughly**: Know their background and company
- **Prepare Questions**: Have specific, thoughtful questions ready
- **Set Clear Expectations**: Confirm the meeting purpose and duration
- **Plan Logistics**: Choose a convenient location for them

### During the Meeting
- **Be Respectful of Time**: Start and end on time
- **Listen More Than You Talk**: This is about learning from them
- **Ask for Advice, Not Jobs**: Don't put them on the spot
- **Take Notes**: Shows you value their input

### Follow-Up
- **Send Thank You**: Within 24 hours
- **Act on Advice**: Show you took their suggestions seriously
- **Keep Them Updated**: Share how their advice helped you
- **Offer Help**: Ask how you can help them in return

## Building Your Network Systematically

### Create a Networking Plan
1. **Identify Target Companies**: Where do you want to work?
2. **Research Key People**: Who works in roles you want?
3. **Find Connections**: How can you get introduced?
4. **Prioritize Outreach**: Start with warmest connections first

### Track Your Efforts
- **Spreadsheet**: Track who you've contacted and responses
- **Follow-Up Schedule**: Set reminders for follow-up communications
- **Measure Results**: Track response rates and meeting success
- **Adjust Strategy**: Modify approach based on what works

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Networking Errors
- **Mass Generic Emails**: Personalization is essential
- **Asking for Jobs**: Ask for advice, not employment
- **One-Way Relationship**: Always think about how you can help them
- **Impatience**: Networking is a long-term strategy

### Email Mistakes
- **Too Long**: Keep initial emails brief
- **Too Vague**: Be specific about what you want to know
- **Poor Grammar**: Proofread everything carefully
- **No Follow-Up**: Always acknowledge their help

## Encouragement

Remember: you are already far ahead of your peers by reaching out and networking proactively. Most people never take this step, so you're already demonstrating initiative and strategic thinking that will serve you well in your career.

Even if 90% of people prefer email over in-person meetings, that still means 10% are willing to meet. And those email conversations can be incredibly valuable if you approach them thoughtfully.

## The Long Game

Networking is not about immediate results - it's about building relationships over time. Someone who can only answer a few questions via email today might become a valuable mentor or connection years from now. The key is to be patient, respectful, and focused on building genuine relationships rather than just seeking immediate benefits.
