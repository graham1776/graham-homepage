                <p>I love coming up with business ideas. Unfortunately, they aren't worth the bytes they're stored on (<a href="http://paulgraham.com/ideas.html" target="_blank">http://paulgraham.com/ideas.html</a>). I am putting all of them out there. Maybe they will inspire you to create something new, start a startup, and make a billion dollars. Some of them i have made attempts at creating, and are linked below. Have fun!</p>
